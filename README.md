# How it works / how to test modal

1. After installing node modules (`npm i`) run `ng serve`
2. Main page will load with `Open Dialog` button
3. Clicking on that button will open a modal with 3 screens, and ability to navigate forward/backward
4. To search for addresses try typing `sydney`, `melbourne` or `rockdale` (I am using mock data, and minimum number of characters to trigger search is 3)
